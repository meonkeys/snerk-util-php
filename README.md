# Snerk PHP Utilities [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/meonkeys/snerk-util-php.png)](http://travis-ci.org/meonkeys/snerk-util-php)

I don't have a great reason for calling this "snerk-util". "generic-util" would
be more accurate, but not as fun.

If this collection of code becomes super popular, maybe someone will come up
with a nice self-recursive acronym expansion of "Snerk".
